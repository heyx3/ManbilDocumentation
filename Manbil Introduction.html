        <h1>Manbil Introduction</h1>
        <div class="TextSection">
            <p>
                Manbil is a 3D game engine designed to be an educational tool. While there are several open-source game
                engines already available, they are generally not designed to be taken apart and studied by students
                interested in learning how these engines tick. Manbil, on the other hand, is created with the goal of
                having very loosely-coupled systems that can be learned from the ground up, without having to understand
                the total complexity of the engine.
            </p>
            <p>
                This documentation assumes the reader is familiar with C++. Familiarity with Visual Studio is also helpful,
                but it isn't required.
            </p>
            <p>
                The engine <a href="https://github.com/heyx3/Manbil">source</a> and
                <a href="https://github.com/heyx3/ManbilDocumentation">documentation</a> are both available on Github.
            </p>
            <p>
                A quick reference guide for setting up the engine and making new projectss is available
                <a href="Quick Start.html">here</a>.

            <ul class="TextSectionList">
                <li>
                    C++
                    <ul class="TextSectionList">
                        <li>Templates are OK; macros are occasionally useful but shouldn't be abused.</li>
                        <li>
                            Exceptions are used very sparingly -- only when less exotic error-handling would
                            substantially clutter otherwise simple functions (for example, the Serialization system).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            STL is used quite a bit, though often functions that take an std::vector will also provide an
                            overload that takes in a raw pointer to an array so that nobody is forced to use std::vectors.
                        </li>

                        <li>A powerful but Windows-only IDE</li>
                        <li>The "Express" edition is free.</li>
                        <li>
                            Other versions (Professional, Ultimate, etc.) are expensive, but free through some student
                            programs (such as Northeastern CCIS!).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            One quirk to note for anybody new to Visual Studio: in the IDE, files are organized into
                            "filters". These function exactly like folders, but they are not actual folders! It is
                            generally a good idea to make sure the folder hierarchy matches the filter hierarchy for
                            simplicity.
                        </li>

                            The engine code should theoretically support OSX and Linux (except the Oculus Rift stuff),
                            but this has never been attempted, let alone tested, and there are no build configurations
                            set up for it.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The engine code should also theoretically support older versions of Windows, but this has
                            not been tested either (and Visual Studio 2013 only works on Windows 7 and later).

                <li>
                    The engine is generous with line breaks to provide clear separation of code based on its context.

                        <li>
                            For example, there are almost always two line breaks between sections in a class declaration
                            (fields, constructors, operators, methods).

                    Max line length is around 105.

                            105 characters is about half the width of a 1080p screen with some wiggle room when using
