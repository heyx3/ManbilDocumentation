        <h1>"DataNode" system</h1>

        <p>
            Provides an extremely flexible, extendable way to create shaders without having to write any shader code.
            The outputs of each shader are defined with a Directed Acyclic Graph (or DAG), a tree-like structure
            of shader operations plugging into other shader operations. This type of system is used in many
            professional game engines to allow designers to create materials without having to write code or
            do complex lighting math.

            <h2>Concept</h2>

            <p>
                The “DataNode” system provides a framework for high-level shader creation.
                It is extremely flexible and extensible, and similar shader creation systems are used in many
                professional engines. While this system does not yet have a GUI application for non-programmers
                to make use of it, it is designed to easily support the creation of such a GUI. It also supports
                serialization (meaning these materials can be saved to/loaded from a file).
            </p>
            <p>
                The basic idea of the system is that the shader programmer creates a “Directed, Acyclic Graph”,
                or DAG (something similar to a tree structure) that describes each shader output as some operation
                that may itself use the outputs of other operations as its inputs.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, the screenshot above is Unreal Engine 4's material editor, which implements this
                same concept with a beautiful UI. The material shown has a diffuse texture’s RGB values plugged into the “BaseColor”
                output, constant values plugged into the “Metallic” and “Roughness” outputs, and a normal map texture
                plugged into the “Normal” output. Finally, there is a “TexCoord” node representing the mesh’s UV
                coordinates that gets plugged in to both textures.
            </p>
            <p>
                One important difference between Unreal’s (and others) system and Manbil’s system is that Manbil
                doesn’t use high-level inputs like “BaseColor” or “Metallic” -- you plug your DataNodes into the
                actual vertex shader and fragment shader outputs, giving you total control over the behavior of
                the material. However, when working on a project of your own, it would be a good idea to create
                such a higher-level interface for these nodes to plug into. It would make things much easier for
                your artists -- they shouldn’t be expected to do all the lighting math themselves every time they
                make a material! There is already a system in Manbil that creates this kind of higher-level
                interface -- the <a href="GPU Particles.html">GPU Particles</a> system -- which you can use as an
                example of how to create such an interface yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another way this system can be extended is by defining your own node types, allowing you to create
                custom operations. The <a href="Water.html">Water</a> system shows an example of this ability,
                providing a special node that calculates water ripples and outputs the height of any given position
                on the water’s surface as well as its surface normal.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another difference between this system and others like it is that you can still write a geometry
                shader to go between the vertex and fragment shaders. However, these geometry shaders must still
                be written as text (albeit with some accompanying meta-data
                about its outputs so that it works nicely with the DataNode system).
            </p>

            <h2>Implementation</h2>

            <p>
                Nodes are instances of the <a href="Data Nodes/DataNode.html">DataNode</a> class. The class itself
                is abstract, and a large number of child classes are already provided, representing all the different
                atomic operations that can be done in a shader (plus a few useful operations that are slightly more
                complex). Every DataNode uses some number of inputs and exposes some number of outputs (often just
                one). All input/output values are floating-point vectors with between 1 and 4 components (referred
                to as the “size” of the input/output).
            </p>
            <p>
                DataNode instances each have a unique name. This name must be a valid GLSL variable (basically the
                same naming rules as any C-like language), as it’s used when generating shader code to give variables
                unique names. The node’s name is given in the constructor; if an empty string is passed, a
                unique name is auto-generated. Unless you want the generated shaders to be more human-readable,
                it's easiest to just let the node names be auto-generated.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because DataNodes have unique names, a static function is provided for getting a
                pointer to any DataNode instance via its name: <code>DataNode::GetNode(std::string name)</code>. Additionally,
                for this reason, nodes cannot be copied, so the DataNode system expects nodes to always be stored in
                instances of the std::shared_ptr class, which automatically handles heap-allocated memory for you.
                For simplicity, the shared_ptr type is typedef-ed as <code>DataNode::Ptr</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inputs into a node are represented as instances of the “DataLine” class. Data lines can actually
                be one of two things:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The output of some DataNode, specified with the node’s name and the 0-based index of which
                        output to use
                    </li>
                    <li>A constant value</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                The DataLine class exposes quite a variety of constructors for convenience. Many nodes only expose
                one output, so by default the DataLine constructor will assume output 0 of a node is being used.
                Thanks to C++’s aggressive implicit conversion rules, the syntax for creating either type of DataLine
                is quite flexible -- for example, you can assign a float value to a DataLine variable, and
                the compiler interprets this as calling the constructor that takes a float as an argument.
            </p>
            <p>
                The DataNode system is fully serializable (using the <a href="../Serialization.html">Serialization</a> system),
                meaning you can quite easily read/write a DataNode material from/to a file.
                DataNode child classes require some simple reflection information in order to be serializable.
                More specifically, they have to define a “factory” function that creates a dummy instance to be
                filled in later with data. This information is easily generated by requiring every
                class that inherits from DataNode to call two macros (described below).
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, the shader outputs are stored in a
                <a href="Data Nodes/SerializedMaterial.html">SerializedMaterial</a> struct, and the actual
                <a href="../Basic Rendering/Material.html">Material</a> instance is generated
                by passing the  SerializedMaterial instance into the static function
                <code><a href="Data Nodes/ShaderGenerator.html">ShaderGenerator</a>::GenerateMaterial()</code>.
            </p>

            <p>
                The way you could something write this with Manbil’s DataNode system would be as follows:
            </p>

            <div class="CodeSample">
                <pre class="prettyprint">
#include “Rendering/Data Nodes/DataNodes.hpp”
...
//Metallic and roughness are just constants.
DataLine metallic = 0.3f;
DataLine roughness = 0.25f;
//For the sake of this example, let’s say that the UV coordinate is the 3rd fragment shader input.
//There is a singleton DataNode called “FragmentInputNode” that just outputs the fragment shader’s inputs for us to use.
DataLine fragShaderUV(FragmentInputNode::GetInstance(), 2);                    
//Normal and diffuse are read in from textures and used as outputs in the fragment shader.
//”TextureSample2DNode” is a DataNode representing a 2D texture parameter.
//It has 6 outputs: Red, Green, Blue, Alpha, RGB, and RGBA.
DataNode::Ptr diffuseSampler(new TextureSample2DNode(fragShaderUV, “u_diffuseSampler”, “diffuseNode”)),
              normalSampler(new TextureSample2DNode(fragShaderUV, “u_normalSampler”, “normalNode”));
//Instead of memorizing which index corresponds to which output, you can just call “TextureSample2DNode::GetOutputIndex()”.
DataLine diffuseRGB(diffuseSampler, TextureSample2DNode::GetOutputIndex(CO_AllColorChannels)),
         normalRGB(normalSampler, TextureSample2DNode::GetOutputIndex(CO_AllColorChannels));
//[now do stuff with the diffuse, normal, metallic, and roughtness values to color/shade the surface]
                </pre>
            </div>

            <p>
                Let’s say we wanted to expose a vec3 uniform parameter “u_tint” that tints the diffuse color:
            </p>

            <div class="CodeSample">
                <pre class="prettyprint">
DataNode::Ptr tintUniform(new ParamNode(3, “u_tint”));
DataNode::Ptr finalDiffuse(new MultiplyNode(tintUniform, diffuseRGB));
//[now use “finalDiffuse” as the diffuse color instead of “diffuseRGB”]
                </pre>
            </div>
